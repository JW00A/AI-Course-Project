# AI-Simulated-Lawyer-Course-Project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

 The main idea behind this project is to create a powerful, or at least sufficiently capable, AI method that assists people in identifying situations requiring legal help. Additionally, it aims to enhance understanding of legal matters based on information available online. As a foundation, any websites allowing information sharing and use could be implemented as a legal basis or database. Examples include official government sites or wiki pages.
 My vision for this AI method is that it will answer questions precisely, drawing from previously discussed information. It will also help determine whether individuals can resolve legal issues independently or if they need legal assistance. Given the variation in legal frameworks across different countries, this AI method will focus on questions related to specific legal contexts or, where applicable, international laws. Importantly, user information should remain private and not be stored for any other purposes.
 To make this project successful, we should employ the following algorithms, models, and techniques: Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning algorithms, and generative language models. The AI method will interact with users as a chatbot, and user feedback will be crucial for continuous improvement. When faced with ambiguous questions, the AI should identify the main issues by asking additional questions or analyzing connections to legal frameworks before providing answers. Additionally, neural networks can be employed for intent classification.

## Background

Solves common legal problems that could arise frequently by giving the right advice or directing the person in the right direction, including whether it's a legal issue and can be currently solved.

## How is it used?

It's a legal assistant chatbot that helps with issue identification and possible solutions.

```
import spacy
import openai  # Install this library using 'pip install openai'

# Load the spaCy NLP model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Example legal text (a more comprehensive dataset is needed)
legal_text = """
This is a sample legal text. It contains relevant information about laws and regulations.
"""

# Preprocess the legal text
doc = nlp(legal_text)

# Extract legal concepts (e.g., named entities)
legal_concepts = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents]

# Simulate user queries (should be replaced this with actual user input)
user_query = "What are the requirements for starting a business?"

# Intent recognition (simplified rule-based approach)
if "requirements" in user_query.lower():
    # Use GPT-4 to generate a detailed response
    gpt_response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=user_query,
        max_tokens=50,
        stop=["\n"],
    )
    response = gpt_response.choices[0].text.strip()
else:
    response = "I apologize, but I couldn't understand your query."

print(response)
```

## Challenges

This chatbot won't be able to solve solutions by itself but should be understood as a legal assistant

## What next?

This project requires good python programmers, AI engineers or people with good knowledge of AI to build it and, obviously, their collaboration.

This project was inspired by Elements of AI courses: https://www.elementsofai.com/

AI support was used while writing this readme file, and what partially inspired this project, in the first place, too(what is an implementation of ChatGPT in Microsoft ChatBot/Search): https://copilot.microsoft.com/
